					Hmm, where should I start? A simple hello should suffice... I guess. So let's begin<br />with that!<p />
					Welcome to my website, I'm an 18 year old high school student with a passion for<br />scripting, programming, coding, designing, you name it. My history with computers is<br />an odd one. My father purchased our first home computer when I was just 2, this was<br />also the age that I would have my first interaction with these wonderful machines. My<br />father was out of the house one day and there was this game I really enjoyed playing,<br />but my mother didn't know how to work DOS so she simply told me to wait for my<br />father to get home. Being my 2 year old self I wasn't going to take no for an answer,<br/>and by the time my mother had come back to check on me I already had the computer<br />on and the game running.<p />
					Now obviously a lot has happened since I was 2. Now I not only know how to run<br />programs in DOS, but I know how to create my own programs as well. Just a taste of<br />some of the languages I've worked with; Delphi, Turing, Visual Basic, VB.NET,<br />VBSCRIPT, BATCH, JavaScript, Java, PHP, CSS, HTML, and a very small amount<br />with C++. My main operatins system is Windows 7, with knowledge on almost all of their previous OS's (including Server editions), and I also know a bit about certain releases of Linux (sorry, I don't do Mac).<p />
					I now work part time for a local computer shop, doing what I enjoy doing, fixing other peoples problems and mistakes haha, writing my own scripts to make my own job easier, and working on personal projects in my spare time (some of which are available for download).<p />
					If for whatever reason you need to contact me, there is a contact form available. You can get to it by clicking on the \"Mail\" icon below or by <a href='#' onclick='openWindow(\"email\");'><<   Clicking Here!   >></a><p />
